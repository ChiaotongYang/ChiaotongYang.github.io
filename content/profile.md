Hi! Thank you for coming to my homepage. 

I am an undergraduate student majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UMJI-SJTU](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). I used to be a research assistant at [OMNILab](http://omnilab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU, under the supervision of Yaohui Jin. After that, I join [John Hopcroft Center](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU and [WangLab](http://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), UMJI-SJTU, under the supervision of Quanshi Zhang and Xudong Wang. My research interests ranges across machince learning, graph computing and edge computing. Now, I am leading two teams to study different topics simultaneously, but I still expect to have summer research opportunities at top universities in Computer Science.
